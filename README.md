# rHaus_Home_Automation
Central core of a series of home automation projects

These home automation projects intend to provide solutions for different home automation requirements, in each case providing:
1) What the project aims to achieve
2) A hardware solution and findings on what alternatives work
3) One of more software solutions. A common feature of these is that they are all intended to run under Indigo (https://www.indigodomo.com/), although they may be adaptable to other systems.
4) Control pages and tips to assist in the integration into an Indigo system. Control pages are provided within dummy Indigo database configured to operate virtually.
